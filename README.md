# 🔌Socket Programming Assignment — Nerve Solutions
This project demonstrates a simple **TCP client-server communication** system in **.NET 8** with **AES encryption/decryption**.



##  📁 Project Structure
The solution contains **two console applications**:

SocketAssignment/

│

├── Server/ → TCP Server app

│ ├── Program.cs

│ └── EncryptionHelper.cs

│

└── Client/ → TCP Client app

├── Program.cs

└── EncryptionHelper.cs

Both projects use the same EncryptionHelper class for **symmetric AES encryption** to securely exchange data.
## ⚙️ Features

### 🖥️ Server
- Listens for incoming TCP client connections (default: port `5000`)
- Decrypts incoming client messages
- Parses requests in the format `SetX-SubKey`
- Looks up values from predefined sets (SetA–SetE)
- Sends back current timestamp **n times** (based on value from set)
- Encrypts responses before sending to the client

### 💻 Client
- Connects to the server via TCP
- Sends an **encrypted message** (e.g. `SetA-Two`)
- Decrypts and displays server responses (timestamps)
- Gracefully handles invalid or empty responses

## 🔐 Message Format

| Example Input | Meaning |
|----------------|----------|
| `SetA-One` | From SetA, pick value `1` → send 1 timestamp |
| `SetA-Two` | From SetA, pick value `2` → send 2 timestamps |
| `SetB-Four` | From SetB, pick value `4` → send 4 timestamps |
| Invalid Input | Server replies with `"EMPTY"` |

## 🧩 Example Flow

### 1️⃣ Run the Server
```bash
dotnet run --project Server

Output:
=== TCP SERVER STARTED ===
Enter port to listen on (default 5000):
Server listening on port 5000...
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Client

```bash
dotnet run --project Client

Output:
=== TCP CLIENT STARTED ===
Enter server IP (default 127.0.0.1):
Enter server port (default 5000):
Enter message (e.g. SetA-Two): SetA-Two
Received: 31-10-2025 19:41:22
Received: 31-10-2025 19:41:23
Client finished.
```

### 🔒 Encryption Details

A simple AES-based symmetric encryption is used to secure communication between client and server.
Both use the same secret key and IV (defined in EncryptionHelper.cs).

### 🚀 How to Run

**1️⃣ Clone this repository**
```bash
dotnet run --project Client
```
2️⃣ Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022 or newer.



3️⃣ Set the Server project as startup → Run (Start Debugging)

4️⃣ Set the Client project as startup → Run in a new console window

 Follow the prompts and observe encrypted communication!
